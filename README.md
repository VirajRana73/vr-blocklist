## ⚡ Workflow Overview

**Visual Diagram:**  [Update domains.txt] → [Trigger GitHub Actions] → [Generate adblock.txt & hosts.txt] → [Validate syntax] → [Commit & Tag Release] → [Deploy to GitHub Pages] → [Users access blocklists]


**Step-by-step Explanation:**  

- **Update domains.txt:** Add or remove domains you want to block.  
- **Trigger GitHub Actions:** Workflow runs automatically on push to main (or can be manually triggered).  
- **Generate adblock.txt & hosts.txt:** Creates sorted, validated blocklists from domains.txt.  
- **Validate syntax:** Checks AdBlock and Hosts formats to prevent broken lists.  
- **Commit & Tag Release:** Saves changes, generates changelog, and creates a version tag.  
- **Deploy to GitHub Pages:** Makes blocklists available via direct URLs.  
- **Users access blocklists:** Users can subscribe to the lists or use them in DNS/blocking tools.
